# Python Mastery: From Basics to Advanced
![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)
This project contains four sessions that explain the Python programming language from the basics to the advanced level. Each session includes concepts and practical examples to help you fully master the language.

## Sessions

### Session 01: Introduction to Python

In this session, you will learn the basics of Python, including:

- **Basic Data Types**: Integers (`int`), floats (`float`), booleans (`bool`), strings (`str`), and `None`.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus.
- **String Manipulation**: Slicing, repetition, and modifying strings.
- **Basic Functions**: `print()`, `input()`, `type()`, `len()`.
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `elif`, `else`.

### Session 02: Control Flow and Loops

In this session, you will dive deeper into controlling program flow using:

- **Loops**: `for` and `while`.
- **Keywords**: `break`, `continue`.
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- **String Methods**: `split()`, `replace()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `capitalize()`.
- **List Operations**: `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`.

### Session 03: Data Structures

In this session, you will explore Python's data structures, including:

- **Lists**: Creating lists, modifying them, and basic operations like `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()`.
- **Tuples**: Differences between lists and tuples, creating tuples, and modifying them.
- **Dictionaries**: Creating dictionaries, accessing values, and modifying dictionaries.
- **Sets**: Creating sets and removing duplicates.

### Session 04: Functions and File Handling

In this session, you will learn:

- **Functions**: Defining functions, passing arguments, and returning values.
- **Lambda Functions**: Using `lambda` to create simple functions.
- **File Handling**: Opening files, reading files, writing to files, and deleting files.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: `map()`, `filter()`.

## How to Use the Project

1. Download the four files (`Session 01.ipynb`, `Session 02.ipynb`, `Session 03.ipynb`, `Session 04.ipynb`).
2. Open the files using Jupyter Notebook or any development environment that supports `.ipynb` files.
3. Start with Session 01 and follow the order until you reach Session 04.
4. Experiment with the code yourself and modify it for a better understanding of the concepts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (can be installed via `pip install notebook`)
